# Day-Planner

The Day Planner we were assigned to build had to meet the following criteria:

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

In order to meet criteria, I had to complete various tasks within HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This was not easy. I'll need to do this over again to drill things down, lol. Pratice makes perfect, eh?
